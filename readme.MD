1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

     PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your_private_key_id
     PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

     CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
You should replace your_project_id, your_private_key_id, your_private_key, your_client_email, your_client_id with the realt values
This informations are linked to a specific Google service account, which is usually associated with a specific project in the Google Cloud Platform, and are usually used to authenticate your app to Google services, like the Google Sheets API in your case. If this information is disclosed, it could potentially allow someone to access your project on Google Cloud Platform or use the services associated with that service account, for that reason they should be stored in a .env file .
