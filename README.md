# Spreadsheet-Mailer-QR
This project leverages the Google Sheets API to fetch participant information from a spreadsheet. It then dynamically generates personalized emails for each participant, incorporating their first and last names into the email content. Additionally, it generates a personalized QR code for each participant and embeds it within the email.

# How to use the code 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the command **npm install** to install all the project's dependencies
3. Create in the project's root directory a .env file
4. Fill out the **.env** file with this informations :
     PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your_private_key_id
     PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

     CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
You should replace your_project_id, your_private_key_id, your_private_key, your_client_email, your_client_id with the realt values
This informations are linked to a specific Google service account, which is usually associated with a specific project in the Google Cloud Platform, and are usually used to authenticate your app to Google services, like the Google Sheets API in your case. If this information is disclosed, it could potentially allow someone to access your project on Google Cloud Platform or use the services associated with that service account, for that reason they should be stored in a .env file .
