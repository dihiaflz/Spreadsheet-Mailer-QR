# Spreadsheet-Mailer-QR
This project leverages the Google Sheets API to fetch participant information from a spreadsheet. It then dynamically generates personalized emails for each participant, incorporating their first and last names into the email content. Additionally, it generates a personalized QR code for each participant and embeds it within the email.
